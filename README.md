*Just my personal password generator that I made...*

For choosing the complexity of the password, you are given options to add:
- Small latin letters
- Large latin letters
- Numbers
- Few widely supported symbols

To choose what characters you would like:
- Enter `a` to include small letters
- Enter `A` to include large letters
- Enter `1` to include numbers
- Enter `!` to include symbols

There is also an option to exclude characters that are harder to read like - 0O Il 1!
- To exclude them, use `X` option.

And one more thing, the password generator refuses to do anything if you request <8 character long password xd
